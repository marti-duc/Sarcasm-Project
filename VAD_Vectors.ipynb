    "This notebook maps every tweet to the VAD dictionary. The VAD Dictionary has almost 14,000 lemmas, each assigned a Valence, Dominance, and Arousal score. When there is a matching lemma in the tweet, it is added to each vector (valence, dominance, arousal). If the lemma appears more than once in the tweet, the values are added. For example, if'be' has a valence score of 2 and appears twice in the tweet, the valence score will be 4 for this vector. \n",

# Sarcasm-Project
Detecting Sarcasm in Twitter Dataset

This project explores linguistic features that contribute to sarcasm detection. The linguistic features are a combination of text and word complexity, stylistic and psychological features. We experiment with sarcastic tweets with and without context. The results of our experiments indicate that contextual information is crucial for sarcasm prediction. One important observation is that sarcastic tweets are typically incongruent with their context in terms of sentiment or emotional load.

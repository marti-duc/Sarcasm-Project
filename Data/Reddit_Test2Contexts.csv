I hope people see this.,"Posting this here for visibility and for those who want to learn about the legal precedent that this ruling was based on. Judge Kelly (a Trump appointee, not that it *should* matter) is bound by precedent set in the Sherill case which you can read here. His ruling will make much more sense after you read it: <URL> **Sherill TLDR**: In order to revoke a pass, The White House must follow the process requirements set forth in the Sherill case/Administrative Procedure Act **(written notice, opportunity for hearing over the matter)** The White House likely didn’t follow the process and that’s in part why the judge ruled the way he did. To be clear, my understanding is that this is just a temporary restoration of Acosta’s pass. P.S. I’m not a lawyer and I only know this because I was literally in the courtroom on Wednesday to listen to the arguments. Shoutout to my new buddy R, who I met at the courthouse and who helped me understand a lot of this. P.P.S: There are actually two matters at hand here. First, the legality of the process by which Acosta’s hard pass was revoked. (This is what is being discussed currently) Second is whether Acosta’s first amendment rights were violated, (That may come later in a separate lawsuit as far as I can tell) P.P.P.S For what’s it worth, I think there is a good chance that they will settle much of the rest of this out of court.

The very wealthy already pay next to nothing in income tax.,"That's not really helpful, either. Conservatives would actually love to get rid of the IRS and income taxes because it would mean more money would stay in the pockets of the very wealthy. You would probably see a push for a national sales tax to offset it, which is, by definition, an extremely regressive tax that would disproportionately impact poor and middle-class people. The decrease in revenue would be an excuse for a gutting of social services and federal programs of all kinds, although probably not the military. Our forty-fifth president is the result of a breakdown in institutions of many sorts. Addressing those issues is more difficult work than further dismantling them. In the words of Sam Rayburn, 'Any jackass can kick a barn down, but it takes a carpenter to build one.'"

1092,NOT_SARCASM,"Hope you never speak to them again, they dont deserve you OP","It's always felt like my parents never wanted me. I was a surprise Honeymoon baby born 9 months and a day after their wedding, I was regularly screamed at for anything I did until I just started hiding, I was called ""the practice child"" my whole life, my younger siblings got way more love and attention, etc. In my teens they started taking in ""strays"". If any neighborhood kids didn't want to go home, they could just be at our house all the time. Effectively, my mother would take my friends away from me to be *HER* friends instead. One of which was a kid who picked on me constantly from the time I was 11. I guess they had that in common. That guy was kicked out of his Dad's house AND his mom's house when he was 20, so my parents took him in permanently. That killed me. But I always wanted their approval, so I was always calm and agreeable, always desperately trying to figure out how to get them to love me, so I went along with it. Years later, I'm married and have a son. This guy still lives with my parents. They continue to coddle and make excuses for him while criticising me for whatever they feel like. One day, we're all at my parents house and my son is being a goofy 2-year-old, which annoys the man-child living there. So he gets furious, picks my son up by his ankle and spanks him. My parents claimed not to have seen it. We went home. I couldn't sleep that night because I was so upset. The next morning, I made sure the guy and my mom would be at home (and why wouldn't he be there) and I went to confront them with my wife. I dumped ***everything*** I had been putting up with on them for about an hour, including asking how my mom could allow this jerk to hit my son. She maintained that it didn't happen, so I went through the roof. I ended up crying because of all the pent-up emotion, so my fantastic wife took over. She said we wouldn't be coming back if the guy still lived there, so he yelled that he would move out and he stormed off after saying he didn't have to listen to this. My parents convinced him ***not*** to move out shortly after we left. My mother expressed how disappointed she was that I didn't come ""to have a conversation"", and only came to ""dump"" on them. ***THAT*** was her big takeaway from everything I said. That I wasn't being ""fair"" to them. We went to counseling with them later. For months. It validated everything I had felt, but they never stopped lying and being defensive. One counselor said we should be on Dr. Phil. The other counselor said my mom is ""incapable of empathy"". Both counselors called my parents delusional. But of course my parents didn't take any of that seriously. At one point my dad asked me ""Who does he think he is to judge us like that?"", as if he forgot that THAT'S THEIR JOB.

So you totally make sense.","I think you are looking at this from a different point of view of those who prefer consoles. I have a PS4 pro, Switch and a PC. Imo, PC is still my platform of choice but both the Switch and PS4 pro have advantages depending on what you prefer and are looking for in a platform to play games. There are a lot of people that do not want to bother with building a PC and just want a simple system where you put the game and play. Many also don't care about customization or about other non-gaming features that a PC offers (many of these people already have a PC to work for example) And yes, PC gaming these days is more convenient than ever, but it's still not as convenient as a console. With a console you don't have to worry about specs, what graphics settings you should use, messing around with them until you find the sweet spot for your framerates, etc (this is one of the reasons why I think the Steam Machine flopped, it offered too many options and was poorly advertised, it just confused people) Steam sales are also no longer a big advantage point for PC because PSN also offers pretty good deals every now and again. Eshop on the other hand sucks on that front. Speaking of sales, you can pick up a ps4 slim or pro for pretty good prices when they are on sale. You can grab a slim for 200 euros or less. And a lot of AAA exclusives in these systems are must play for gamers. They offer great gameplay and stories, great experiences and without bashing you with MX and loot boxes. Personally, I think platform wars are fun as a joke, but they are extremely dumb if you take them seriously. The better platform is ultimately subjective. It depends on what you want from a platform"

Photos and videos online capture colored-water cannons dispersing protesters everywhere from Argentina to Malaysia to Hungary, and Israeli police have used colored water on protesting Palestinians (see above) and Jewish settlers in the past several years (the water aimed at settlers being evacuated from Gaza also contained turpentine).

In my hometown there was a friend of mine who was accused of raping an underage girl. If remember correctly he was 19 and she was 16, and she claimed rape.

This led to his mugshot being in the local paper, him getting death threats on social media, etc, etc. But when the trial came she admitted to lying about it because her parents would be mad if they found out she was having premarital sex. Was there an article in the newspaper about that? Of course not. He was basically exiled from the area because nobody would hire this “rapist” who turned out to be completely innocent. He seems to be doing fine now, living in a different area all together, but I’m sure that experience was extraordinarily traumatic for him in the first place (going to jail, court, investigation, all of that) and then being shunned by the entire community.
